China, the Taliban's most important partner, has said it sees the setting up of the new government in Afghanistan by the Taliban as an end to the anarchy that has been going on in the country for the past two weeks. China also said it is ready to keep the communication channel with the Taliban open. This warming up comes though China is wary of the Taliban providing support to Uyghur separatists.

Taliban, on the other hand, said that they are very appreciative of China's aid and projects. The Taliban consider China as the most important partner, a Taliban spokesperson said.

Experts have started reading between the lines and breaking down the driving factors between the Taliban and China being warm to each other from day one.

'China's interest in Beld and Road'

China does not want any reforms in Afghanistan. Neither do issues like human rights and women's rights are ever China's priority, Chinese dissident Jianli Yang wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Times. "China's own interests must be the starting point for Beijing's review of the ever-changing situation in Afghanistan. China has no interest in reforming Afghanistan, nor does it have the strength to do so," he wrote.
